        <p>
          As a graduate from Bina Nusantara University, I possess a solid educational background in computer science,
          complemented by hands-on experience gained during internships as a QA Tester and Technical Writer. My tenure
          in these roles has honed my skills in software testing methodologies and technical documentation, ensuring
          product quality and clarity in communication. Additionally, I recently completed an intensive programming
          bootcamp with Dicoding Indonesia, specializing in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which provided me with a
          comprehensive understanding of front-end web development principles. With a fervent passion for technology and
          a proactive mindset, I am eager to contribute to dynamic and innovative tech environments, leveraging my
          diverse skill set to drive meaningful impact and collaborate effectively with like-minded professionals..

        <p>
          During my one-year internship at the Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia, I served
          dual
          roles as a Technical Writer and a QA Tester. As a Technical Writer, I meticulously crafted comprehensive
          technical
          documentation concerning legal policies and human rights protocols, ensuring clarity and accessibility for
          stakeholders. Transitioning into the role of a QA Tester, I conducted rigorous testing procedures to evaluate
          the
          functionality and performance of software applications and systems utilized within the ministry, while also
          meticulously documenting any encountered issues. This experience not only enhanced my understanding of legal
          frameworks but also refined my technical, analytical, and communication skills, preparing me for future
          challenges in professional environments.

          <p>
            As the lead developer, I was responsible for designing a comprehensive software system, which involved
            creating
            UML diagrams to illustrate the functionality and interactions of both users and the application itself. This
            process included crafting detailed narrative texts outlining the application's purpose, features, and user
            interactions. Additionally, I utilized various UML diagrams such as activity diagrams, use cases, domain
            model
            class diagrams, and first cut sequence diagrams to provide a holistic overview of the system's architecture
            and
            behavior. These diagrams served as crucial documentation, aiding in the understanding of the software's
            functionalities and facilitating communication among team members and stakeholders.

            Testing software for applications to be launched by the Ministry of Law and Human Rights involves careful
            planning, preparing suitable testing environments, executing comprehensive testing scenarios, reporting test
            results to developers for fixes, and maintaining thorough documentation. With these steps, testing
            objectives
            can
            be achieved effectively, ensuring that the applications function optimally, meet user needs, and comply with
            relevant regulations and standards.

        <h4>Sep 2018 - Jul 2023</h4>
        <p>
          During my time at Binus University, I undertook a project that involved creating a dashboard from data,
          crafting
          application narratives, developing UML diagrams, and designing UI/UX elements. This experience has honed my
          skills
          in utilizing tools such as visual paradigm and Microsoft Visio to construct detailed UML diagrams, including
          activity diagrams and use cases. Moreover, I have gained proficiency in designing applications by focusing on
          user
          experience (UX) and user interface (UI), employing techniques like storyboarding, wireframing, and UI design.
          Additionally, I have developed expertise in leveraging Tableau to build interactive and insightful dashboards.
          These capabilities enable me to effectively translate complex technical concepts into comprehensive
          documentation
          that resonates with end-users.
